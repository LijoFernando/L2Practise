5. Given a 2D array of n x m dimensions where each row is sorted. Find the
0-based index of the first row that has the maximum number of 1's.and
replace the rows with 0's
Input:
N = 4 , M = 4
 Arr[ ][ ] = { {0, 1, 1, 1},
 {0, 0, 1, 1},
 {1, 1, 1, 1},
 {0, 0, 0, 0} }
output:
{ { 0, 1, 1, 1}
 { 0, 0, 1, 1}
 { 0, 0, 0, 0}
 { 0, 0, 0, 0} }

7. Write a Program to Sort 2D Array Across Left Diagonal
Sample Input: Matrix without sorting
5 2 0 7 1
3 4 2 9 14
5 1 3 5 2
4 2 6 2 1
0 6 3 5 1
Sample Output: Matrix after sorting
1 2 0 7 1
3 2 2 9 14
5 1 3 5 2
4 2 6 4 1
0 6 3 5 5
8. Given a matrix mat[][] of dimension N*M, a positive integer K and the
source cell (X, Y), the task is to print all possible paths to move out of the
matrix from the source cell (X, Y) by moving in all four directions in each
move in at most K moves.
Sample Input: N = 2, M = 2, X = 1, Y = 1, K = 2
Sample Output:
(1 1)(1 0)
(1 1)(1 2)(1 3)
(1 1)(1 2)(0 2)
(1 1)(0 1)
(1 1)(2 1)(2 0)
(1 1)(2 1)(3 1)
Sample Input: N = 1, M = 1, X = 1, Y = 1, K = 2
Sample Output:
(1 1)(1 0)
(1 1)(1 2)
(1 1)(0 1)
(1 1)(2 1)

10. Let's play a game!! Given a matrix mat[ ][ ] with n x m elements.
Your task is to check if the matrix is Super Similar or not. To perform this
task you have to follow these Rules: Firstly all even index rows to be
Rotated left and odd index rows to right, And Rotation is done X
times(Index starting from zero). Secondly, After all the Rotations check if
the initial and the final Matrix are the same Return 1 else 0.

11. Given a 2D grid of n*m of characters and a word, find all
occurrences of a given word in a grid. A word can be matched in all 8
directions at any point. Word is said to beClick link for sample input and
output : found in a direction if all characters match in this direction (not in
zig-zag form). The 8 directions are, horizontally left, horizontally right,
vertically up, vertically down and 4 diagonal directions.
